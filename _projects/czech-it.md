Czech-IT! is an open-source and open-data linguistic corpus of native Czech learners acquiring Italian language, composed by different kinds of communicative situations, in order to reveal a wide range of phenomena.

Second Language Acquisition (SLA) is a fertile field of research in linguistic studies, either by applied and empirical standpoints or from theoretical and general perspectives. This corpus stands for comparative and contrastive analyses exhibited by linguistic patterns among languages during the acquisitional path.

I am a co-founder of the project, for which I am involved in the digital elaboration and in the usage of Natural Language Processing tools for automated and statistic tasks.
