As XXX [job:position] in YYY [job:city] I am involved in the study of Italian and Romance Linguistics. My research interests span across digital humanities, computational linguistics and theoretical syntax. 

I love to partecipate in team and collective brainstorming for research-related activities. I am open for collaborations in such fields and for interdisciplinary initiatives.
