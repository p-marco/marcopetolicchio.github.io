Introduction
============

Analysis of case marking phenomenon is one of the major field raised up
in the last decades of linguistics studies. It is firstly due to the
growing of syntactic oriented point of view in analizing human language,
from empyrical data into theoretical perspective in order to describe
language (epi-)phenomenic variations within a parametrical possibility
of displacement and ordering of syntactic structures.

In the opening of his handbook centered on case topic, Blake states:
“Case is a system of marking dependent nouns for the type of
relationship they bear to their head”[^1]. In generative literature
Inflection is due to a raising of a lexical item in order to satisfy its
feature into a probe-goal relationship, where a Functional Projection is
a case-assigner that assigns a morphematic realization (abstract) to a
syntactic element. Choice of case mechanism is accountable into a
functional sequence, where the different realizations are displaced into
a certain inflectional paradigm, as stated in Caha (2009).

Case marking is due to Spec-Head Relationship, where Specifier is
Operational Category and Head is a lexical entry[^2], as operation of
Merge between a lexical head and its specifier (functional) position.

According to *Mirror Principle* in DM (Hale, Nevins...)[^3], morphology
is distributed and ordered into syntactic structures and, so on a
morpheme is somewhat understable as a functional and lexical content
itself, builded by syntactic operations. If we assume some of the newest
theoretical design of the architecture of Human Language faculty, its
realization and its design status, derived by MP (Chomsky 1995),
henceforth Cartography (Rizzi, Cinque...), DM (Hale...), Nanosyntax
(Starke, Caha...), we’re in the way to describe syntax as an operation
in which operate functionally motivated entities.

Those (sub-)syntactic entities are not been know directly by speaker
(hearer): syntactic operations build up from submorphemic entities[^4],
indipendently by their lenght (and, we can say, whithout a direct
meaning)[^5].

Case assignment is due to a local relationship between a Probe (a
functional category) and a Goal (lexical), where this carryes in syntax
a set of features to be valued and deleted in course of derivation. In
recent generative literature (Chomsky 2001, 2008) Agree is an operation
where a Case Assigner (Probe) finds the closest Case Assignee DP (Goal)
to which assign case feature and morphosyntactic realization. Nanosyntax
approach investigate case assignment mechanism in order to account
either a diacronic way (e.g. syncretism between inflectional markers on
DPs) and in syncronic point of view, where a numbered list of Case
Competitors are present in narrow syntax.

Aim of this paper is to reconsider grammatical case assignment and
alternation in Finnish paradigm, showing up how Functional categories
inside and outside DP-shells enter into derivation and how they check
Case on NPs.

The minimalist framework
========================

In this section I would to report some theoretical notes about
inflectional procedure of case-marking in terms of a minimalist
orientated grammar description. Firstly, the syntax component of
language is a computational module, based on link between Functional and
Lexical categories. A syntactical item carries in syntax a set a feature
to be valued in course of derivation. Functional category operates as a
*Probe* in respect to value features of the *Goal*. Features are valued
in course of derivation and then they are deleted. Valuing feature is
based on *Feature Identity*. Features are atomic set of informations
about grammatical and semantic-representational notion of linguistic
sign. Syntactic and grammatical features are valued in an operation in
which a Probe match feature with a Goal, valuing it. Traditionally,
case-marking represent an example of minimalist syntax, where a Case
assignator corresponds to the Probe and the case assignée the Goal.
Inflection is, syntactly, the operation of Interpreting Uninterpretable
Features. Syntax is built up from *uninterpretable* features, unvalued
in syntax:

1.  A phrase is “active” (as a Goal) when it carries a set of
    *uninterpretable* features, *u*F;

2.  For a Goal exists a probe that assign values to *u*F converting into
    *interpretable* (*i*F)[^6];

3.  Goal is attracted by Probe in order to satisfy valuing operation of
    its features;

4.  Matching is based on identity of features;

5.  Matching is an operation of Agree. It can involves into movement
    effect[^7];

6.  Features are valued and deleted: \[$<$Value$>$;$<$Attribute$>$\].

Similarly, a lexical item enters into syntactic representation with an
uninterpretable feature of case assignment (\[*u*Case\]). Case
realization is due to operation of assign value to *u*F (\[*i*Case:X\]).
Case theory in minimalist syntax explains case as an operation of
*Agree* between a Functional category and a Noun (Phrase). For example,
in a transitive construction we have

\[xy\] ( kiss ( x,y ) ) \[tm\] Tom kisses Mary \[mt\] Mary kisses Tom
\[lat\] Puer basiat puellam (Puella basiat puerum)

Case mechanism represent the encoding of syntactical properties of N, in
terms of valuing features, operating into a subset of the whole set of
features that N carries in syntax, i.e. morphosynctactic features.

From minimalist syntax grow up two formal frameworks as Distributed
Morphology (DM) and Nanosyntax[^8]. In DM-oriented framework, the
Vocabulary Insertion is the operation in which a vocabulary item
corresponding to the formal realization on phonological level of some
structures is matched against syntactic structures. Choice of morpheme
is due to *Subset Principle* (Halle-Marantz):

> $''$The phonological exponent of a Vocabulary item is inserted into a
> morpheme... if the item matches all or a subset of the grammatical
> features specified in the terminal morpheme. Insertion does not take
> place if the Vocabulary item contains features not present in the
> morpheme. Where several Vocabulary items meet the conditions for
> insertion, the item matching the greatest number of features specified
> in the terminal morpheme must be chosen$''$.

In nanosyntax case is a morphological realization of sub-syntactic
structures: syntax is build up from sub-morphemes. A morph is the
phonological exponent of a syntactic tree itself, made up from
submorphemic entities[^9] and corresponds to the whole structure, where
case paradigm is depicted as a set of various layers (functional
categories) which includes each other in a determined way where the
sequence of case-competitors is a functional sequence in which every N
projects a structure upon its phrase with all the case paradigm in an
ordered fashion. Case assignment is a probe-goal relationship. As for
subset, in nanosyntax it goes under *Superset principle* (Starke 2005):

> $"$The phonological exponent of a vocabulary item is inserted into a
> node if the item matches all or a superset of the grammatical features
> specified in the node. Insertion does not take place if the vocabulary
> item does not contain all features present in the node. Where several
> items meet the conditions for insertion, the item containing fewer
> features unspecified in the node must be chosen$"$.

In the case of more than one candidates, selection is explainable with
*Elsewhere condition*, for which $"$If there are more candidates, it
inserts the best match$"$[^10] . In nanosyntax each case is compounded
by adjoining tree of lower level. Say, for example, a three case
paradigm for nominal inflection (a common situation):

$[$NOM$]$ =$[$x$]$ ⇔ phoneme /A/ $[$ACC$]$ =$[$x,y$]$ ⇔ /B/ $[$OBL$]$
=$[$x,y,z$]$ ⇔ /C/

The vocabulary item /A/ (i.e a morph) is underspecified for match
\[ACC\] features and /C/ is overspecified to mark a nominative, because
it is morphological realization of a syntactic tree composed by merging
of atomic features x,y,z[^11].

Vocabulary items are inserted to the end of (cyclic) stages of
derivation[^12].

Differently from earlier generative enterprises, minimalist-derived
frameworks describe a noun as a non-fully inflected lexical item from
Lexicon[^13]. So we can go into a description of various stages of a
noun inflection:

1.  A noun accesses from Lexicon into Syntax procedures;

2.  It carries a set of *u*F, i.e Case;

3.  Noun is active (*Goal*);

4.  Case competitors is a *Probe* category for match case value;

5.  $[$*u*Case:$]$ $\longrightarrow$ $[$*i*Case:X$]$;

6.  Vocabulary insertion is described by Subset/Superset Principle;

7.  Case value is assigned and it is adjoined to lexical item. Now it
    enters into Spellout operation, where inflectional morph is spelled
    in phonological form[^14].

Accusative/partitive alternation in Object NPs
==============================================

Finnish grammar exhibits morphosyntactic alternation between two case
competitors for O-function NPs, namely accusative and partitive. This
alternation is explicable by the Aspect function of the verb (or
aspectual semantics of verb): as stated by Kiparsky a terminative
(bounded) VP assignes an accusative object, a durative (unbounded)
selects a partitive one (1a-b), while a subclass of verbs select a
partitive for object, associated with an inherent durative semantics of
verbs (as in emotional verbs):

Tyttö luki kirja-n\
Woman read.3s book.ACC\
“Woman red a book” Tyttö luki kirja-a\
Woman read.3s book.PART\
“Woman was reading a book” Minä rakastan sinu-a/\*sinua-n\
Me love.1s you.PART/\*you.ACC\
“I love you” (Karlsson, 85)

Also Finnish exhibits this case alternation in order to mark a definite
object (accusative) or a not definite (partitive):

Osta-n jatelo-n\
Buy.1s Icecream.ACC\
“I buy an ice-cream” Osta-n jaatelo-a\
Buy.1s Icecream.PART\
“I buy some ice-cream”

In Finnish morphology there isn’t an overt accusative case we could
abscribe to the inflectional paradigm. In singular it is realized in the
same way of genitive, while in plural it is congruent with nominative.
As described by Caha (2009), accusative in Finnish is somewhat as a *non
autonomous* case:

  ------ ------------- -------------
          flower, sg.   flower, pl.
  Nom       kukka-Ø      kukka-t-Ø
  Acc       kuka-n       kukka-t-Ø
  Gen       kuka-n       kuka-den
  Part      kukka-a      kukka-j-a
  ------ ------------- -------------

Partitive case marker is checked under a functional projection related
to the aspect of verb[^15], namely Asp. When it carries a \[-B\]
feature, assigns partitive case to the internal DP, while when Asp case
is off the internal argument is an accusative (draw the tree): ”an
object is partitive either if it governed by one of a class of unbounded
verbal predicates (the aspectual condition), or if it is quantitatively
indeterminate (the NP-related condition)” (Kiparsky,*Partitive*; 6).

Boundedness is a feature of noun and verb shells where:

A predicate P is \[-B\] iff it is divisive and cumulative and not
diverse.[^16]

Boundedness is a feature of VP: or an head V is filled by a \[+B\]
feature, or its complement is a bounded element:

Boundedness is a feature of noun and verb, where a verb assigns
partitive case to its[^17] DP-internal argument.

Partitive/accusative alternation is also found on telicity feature of
VP, where a telic predicate assigns \[*i*k:ACC\], while an atelic checks
partitive (examples are from Kiparsky, *Patitive*; 2):

Etsi-n kah-ta karhu-a / \*kaksi karhu-a / \*karhu-n\
Seek.1sg Two.PART Bear.PART.Pl / Two.ACC Bear.PART / Bear.ACC\
“I’m looking for two bears”. Tapo-i-n karhu-n / kaksi karhu-a / karhu-t\
Kill.PST.1sg Bear.ACC / ACC PART / Pl.ACC\
“I killed the (a) bear  two bears  the bears”

Accusative case is assigned by Asp projection, associated with
\[+telic\] feature; Partitive is checked by a functional head lower in
the tree[^18]

Nominative, Ø and Partitive alternation in subject encoding
===========================================================

According with typologycal studies, nominative is the smallest case in
terms of morphologycal markedness, where it is encoded by a null morph
in the singular and the morph of plural forms in plural (without a
specific case marker)[^19].

Divisible subjects epressing an indefinite quantity are founded in
partitive singular but it seems notable that a nominative subject seems
to be sensible to syntactical order, where a partitive can be a post
verbal subject (c-d):

Pakastime-ssa on leipä-ä\
Freezer.INESS Be.3s Bread.PART\
“There is some bread in freezer” Leipä-Ø on pakastime-ssa\
Bread.NOM Be.3s Freezer.INESS\
“Bread is in the freezer”

lapse-t leikki-vät piha-lla\
child-NOM.PL Play.PAST courtyard-in\
piha-lla leikki-i laps-i-a\
courtyard-in Play.3s child.PART.PL\

Also, partitive is the standard subject of negative clauses:

Kadu-lla ei ole auto-a\
Street.A NEG Be.3s Auto.PART\
“A/The car isn’t in the street” Kooli-s ei ole rektori-t\
school-INE NEG be.CNG headmaster-PART\
“There is no headmaster in the school” (Estonian)

Nominative subjects agree in person and number features with verb, while
partitive subject DPs don’t trigger agreement, where verb is at default
form (3sing):

Nämä poja-t juokse-vat piha-lla\
These.NOM Boy.N/A.Pl run.3pl Yard.ADESS\
“These boys run in the yard”. Sali-n taka.osa-ssa istu-u koululais-i-a\
room-GEN back.part-INE sit-PRS.3SG schoolchild-PL-PAR\
“There are schoolchildren sitting in the back of the room”. keittiössa
on laps-i-a\
Kitchen.INESS Be.3s Child.Pl.PART.\
’There are children in the kitchen"

Partitive encodes intransitive subjects of presentational verbs[^20],
because of subj is DP-internal argument generated (behaviour is not
quite different to inaccusatives).DP-partitive subject are also
associated with locative arguments.

Structural and lexical cases in Finnish
=======================================

In a simple finite sentence, functional categories are C, T, v, V.

According with some of newest analysis of syntax we’re going to draw a
little bit fine-grained structure, as depicted in Bobaljiik (1993,
1995), in Cartographic enterprise and so on[^21].

One could say how could we state somewhat about grammatical core cases
in order to explain their behaviour into a theoretical perspective to a
testable way.

Accounting into newest approaches to Case marking systems into a
minimalist view (Chomsky 1995) to Nanosyntax (Caha 2009), basing on
typological perspective offered by (Blake 2001), Case is a
morphosyntactic realization where a lexical root - where a root is
somewhat as a “bundle of features” (in terms of Alexiadou 2005) - is
adjoined to a morph, checked into a functional sequence of case
assigners: syntax is build up from probe-goal relationship in
submorphemic terms and Spellout operates cyclicaly into phase domain. In
this terms, a root projects its functional domain with fseq of
case-competitors in order to check case features.

Case assignment undergoes *Superset Principle* (Starke 2005) rather than
*Subset Principle* (Halle 1997) for DM-derivated frameworks.

In Caha’s proposal Case markers are ordered in a hierarchical structure
of functional projections within phase domain. Phase domain are the
space within Spell-Out operates ciclically (Chomsky, 2001).

Partitive in finnish seems to be a structural case[^22] where a possible
order of inflectional paradigm would be as follow:

( Nom Acc Part ) Gen \[ Dimensional ecc...

If we accept this ordered hierarchy for Finnish system we have to
conclude that (a) syncretism between acc and gen in singular is an
homophony or (b) partitive is not a structural case, it is on the top of
genitive or (c) genitive itself is a structural case.

In Caha Estonian[^23] paradigm of structural cases is ordered as Nom -
Acc - Gen - Part. This hierarchy is the morphologycal corrispondent to
the core of case, which on the left is covered by genitive, until on the
top of the hierarchy, with dimensional cases:

... \[ Recipient \[ Partitive \[ Direct Object \[ Subject \[
nP\]\]\]\]\]

Partitive case assignment is governed by a \[-B\] feature in Asp
projection of VP. Semantic core of computation for partitive nouns
marking is shared by VP and DP domain. Asp projection would be in TAM
zone of verb domain rapresentation (it will be on the top of VP, at
bottom of AgrO projection). AgrO and Asp share case feature assigner,
valuing it in ACC for \[+B\] verbs and in PART for \[-B\]. Accusative is
licensed by agree between AgrO and DP, Partitive undergoes Aspectual
properties. A DP-internal argument raises to inflectional category with
all the fseq, and it is adjoined in operational category in pied-piping
movement[^24].

Where is accusative?
====================

As stated before, there isn’t a specific case marker for accusative. In
singular form it is the same to genitive ending (*-n*), while in plural
it is identical to nominative (*-t*). So we could say that singular
genitive covers accusative singular functions and nominative plurals
mark accusative-behaviored nouns. Or, in other terms, there is a non
accidental sincretism between acc/gen sg. and nom/acc pl, in line with
Caha prevision based on Blake’s hierarchy:

sg: NOM - ACC $\leftarrow$ GEN - PART ... pl: NOM $\leftarrow$ ACC - GEN
- PART ...

Accusative is a *non-autonomous* case (Caha, 2009) because is not
possible to distinguish its morphological realization from contiguous
cases in full-NPs (\[tab:a\]), but it is different marked for pronouns
(\[tab:b\]):

  ------------- ------ ------
  \[tab:a\]      sg.    pl.
  Obj: \[+B\]    gen    nom
  Obj: \[-B\]    part   part
  ------------- ------ ------

  ----------- ----- ------- -----
  \[tab:b\]    sg.    pl.    PRO
  NOM          -0     -t     -0
  ACC          -n     -t     -t
  GEN          -n    -j-en   -n
  ----------- ----- ------- -----

As stated in [@vainikka] Direct object case licensing is due to
functional categories upon v-V shell:

-   by Aspect head, if overtly marked accusative case;

-   by Agr head, if the DP does not carry \[+plural\] feature;

-   by C as a Last-Resort operation in order to satisfy \[+case\]
    feature[^25]

\[ CP C $\textsubscript{[ $\textit{i}$ K:NOM]}$ \[AgrP DP1
$\textsubscript{[$\textit{u}$ K,$\pm$ pl.]}$ \[Agr’ Agr \[ TP T \[ AspP
Asp $\textsubscript{[$\textit{i}$ K:ACC]}$ \[ vP DP2
$\textsubscript{[$\textit{u}$ K]}$ \[ v’ v...

Conclusive remarks
==================

We saw how case assignment mechanism is explainable, into both
perspective (DM, Nanosyntax), as a probe-goal motivated behaviour.
Choice of morphological exponent between more than one case competitors
is governed by Elsewhere Condition: (i) a more specific vocabulary item
is inserted against a less specific; (ii) given two rules R1 and R2 in
an environment E, R1 takes place before R2 if it applies to a subset of
environments E’ of E.

For this last definition we accreditate Caha’s proposal of a case
paradigm as a functional sequence where case declension is somewhat as a
merging procedure[^26], where \[x\] is less specific than \[x,y\]. For
example, accusative/partitive alternation is

-   $[$ACC$]$ $\rightarrow$ \[+object\] / \[—, -durative\]

-   $[$PART$]$ $\rightarrow$ \[+object\] / \[—, +durative\]

Further research will be discussed in terms of structural/non structural
case checking and its status into grammatical mechanism. If we follow
Nanosyntax approach we have to define partitive as a non structural case
or considering genitive a structural itself. This could be well
motivated by syncretic nature of nom-acc(pl) and acc-gen(sg), where, as
we stated before, there is no syncretism between two (or more) non
contigue cases in the hierarchy. Also, partitive is found to be an
alternative for nominative in intransitive sentences for presentational
(existential) verbs. Following Superset Principle we can say that
partitive *includes* all the cases on its left (Nom, Acc, Gen), yelding
a more specific environment. Then, vocabulary insertion takes place
matching features of Vocabulary item and environment, applying value to
features. Optimal candidate is the one lefts the littlest set of
features without a corrispective valutation by morphological
realization, i.e the phoneme /A/ (abstract representation) can match
either X than Y in absence of a more specific marker.:

/A/ ⇔ \[x,y,z\]

$[$Case:Y$]$ $\longrightarrow$ \[x,y\] ⇔ /A/ $[$Case:Z$]$
$\longrightarrow$ \[x,y,z\] ⇔ /A/

/A/ ⇔ \[x,y\]; /B/ ⇔ \[x,y,z\]

$[$Case:Y$]$ $\longrightarrow$ \[x,y\] ⇔ /A/ $[$Case:Z$]$
$\longrightarrow$ \[x,y,z\] ⇔ /B/

Distinctions by structural cases and non str. are firstly explainable
considering structural case the ’default’ form for mark verb argument.
In a nom/acc language in a transitive construction we have two DPs as
role: an external argument marked with nom and an internal with acc.
While Nominative is linked to \[+EPP\] feature on Tense Phrase (TP)[^27]
so subject moves to Spec, TP in order to satisfy case feature (strong
EPP), Accusative is matched by verb. Nominative and accusative share
\[+structural\] feature, and accusative yelds \[+dependent\], based on
argument triggered only by the transitivity of verb; on a grammatical
point of view accusative is often more marked than nominative[^28].
Encoding of non-structural case is linked to thematic level of VP in
order to mark their argument[^29].

Nanosyntax approach give us the idea of an inflectional paradigm built
up from bundles of features in merge operation. Merge of two features
yelds a more specific environment in terms of Caha[^30] and matching
features, based on identity of features, converts *u*F into *i*F, i.e.
Case.

Finally, traditional distinction between structural and non structural
cases is maybe explainable in terms of adjoining features in merge
operations, where structural are referred only to valency of verb while
others could be governed by pragmatic factors (vocative, topic/nom in
japan.), or to express semantically motivated proto roles (Goal,
Path...).

On grammatical layer of analysis we could describe case marking as the
signal of syntactic/argumental position of an head noun into a sequence,
where the morphological realization of case is mirror of syntactic
operation of agree between a probe and a goal in minimalist terms.

[^2]: As stated by Kayne (1994) in *Linear Corrispondence Axiom (LCA)* ,
    he describes Human Language (CHL) as a Spec-Head-Complement ordered
    in terms of precedence and linearity. Epiphenomenical configurations
    are explainable by movement and other syntactic operations (syntax
    is a cyclic operation); neverthless the core of syntactic system in
    language seems to be as an atomic set of ordered elements into an
    ordered fashion.

[^3]: Mirror Principle states: $"$Morphological derivations must
    directly reflect syntactic derivation (and vice versa)$"$ (cit. in
    Baker, 1985).

[^4]: One could say how could we account for a useful theory of meaning
    in a submorphemic design of language.

[^5]: There are some not trivial differences between *function* and
    *meaning* of a linguistic element in theoretical status and its
    consequences for syntax and the shape of human language (but it’s
    not the time to investigate it over, now).

[^6]: F is for the ’set’, f for each feature.

[^7]: Weak features do not trigger overt movement to satisfy checking
    features, while strong features do.

[^8]: The major authors in the two fields are Halle, Marantz, Calabrese,
    Bobajilik for DM; Svenonius, Caha, Pancheva for nanosyntax.
    Inflectional and derivational morphology are treated in terms of an
    unique effect in DM-works; this problem will not be addressed here.

[^9]: As notably, both approaches shares a functional ground in
    syntactic representation.

[^10]: Also: (a) allow first the more specific morpheme and (b) given
    two vocabulary items applies which corresponds to a more specific
    environment.

[^11]: For nanosyntax, *non accidental* syncretism is possible *only*
    between two adjacent cases and it proceeds from right to left (from
    more specific to the less one); cfr. Caha, *cit*. Accidental forms
    of paradigm reduction could be due to phonological development,
    independently of functional motivations.

[^12]: Human Language faculty is described as an economic system. Syntax
    shows economy in terms of number of operations and locality domains.

[^13]: Informally Lexicon is somewhat as a linguistic storage, in which
    morphs, nouns ecc. are stored

[^14]: For example in Finnish case realization V.I takes place before
    than full-NP spellout, how is visible in stem-consonantal gradation.

[^18]: In this fashion we have a transparent argument structure
    encoding, where C$\rightarrow$\[k:NOM\], Asp$\rightarrow$\[k:ACC\]
    and a lower FP$\rightarrow$\[k:PART\]. Status of partitive case is a
    little bit unclear, if it is a structural or inherent/lexical case.

[^19]: Another hypotesis describes -t as a portmanteaux morpheme sharing
    number and case.

[^20]: Or existential. See Kiparsky, *Structural case...*.

[^21]: FP is a generic functional projection. Label is not adressed
    here.

[^22]: Nor only a ’weak’ structural case (Kiparsky, *cit*.).

[^23]: Estonian declension is well comparable to Finnish, instead
    relationship among the two languages.

[^24]: Pied-piping is a movement nor only of lexical head but also of an
    island and maximal projection of a phase. This movement is strictly
    linked with *Superset Principle*: ”A phonological exponent is
    inserted into a node if its lexical entry has a (sub-)constituent
    that is identical to the node (ignoring traces)” (Starke, 2005) in
    (Caha, *cit*.).

[^25]: A functional head (as a case assigner) is a Probe that selects
    its operation to a Goal (i.e a case assignee). Selection, check and
    agree are operations between a probe and a goal, where the goal
    carryes in narrow syntax some uninterpretated features ( \[*u*F\])
    to be valued by functional projections, that will become
    interpretable (\[*i*F\]), where ’F’ is a generic feature, i.e. for
    case we have \[*u*K\] where K=case. Probe goes downward in the tree.

[^26]: In merge operation the environment will be more specific. For
    *Els. Cond.*,(ii) we say that operations of merge between cases make
    different layer of more specific environment (so, the environment
    for Accusative is more specific than one for Nominative).

[^27]: Also in Complementizer Phrase, CP.

[^28]: Ergative languages show a reverse pattern: absolutive \[-marked,
    -dependent\], ergative \[+marked, + dependent\].

[^29]: For example, emoter predicates are widespreadly associated with
    Dative case on their Experiencer (*Mi piace la pasta* ma *I like
    pasta*). In last, finnish exhibits genitive subjects for embedded
    clause and for necessive constructions.

[^30]: It’s not trivial to indagate how those atomic features could be
    combined to form a paradigm and how they can be deleted in merging
