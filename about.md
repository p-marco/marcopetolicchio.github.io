**I am a linguist in love with computational thinking.**

Graduate in Linguistics, I have discussed an MA Thesis on the phenomenon of split ergativity in Hittite language. I have attended courses in communication, SEO writing, digital marketing, and programming, which have enhanced my computational thinking skills.

My research interests span across two major fields: syntax in generative models and digital humanities: I really love the formal side of linguistics, and I am enthusiastic by the applications of digital instruments in humanities.

My linguistic background and the digital skills are useful for corporates: texts analyses, good communication, eye-catching messages are a plus in these activities.

**Passionate about humanities and digital technologies, I love to interact with data.**

I am currently collaborating at PoLet500 - Polemiche Letterarie del Cinquecento for the digital planning of the project, as IT Supervisor.

I enjoy continuous and cumulative learning in different fields, in which I can get involved through freelance activities. I am also open for collaborations around open source and open access initiatives.
