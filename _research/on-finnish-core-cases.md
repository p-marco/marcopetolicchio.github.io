Analysis of case marking phenomenon is one of the major field raised up in the last decades of linguistics studies. It is firstly due to the growing of syntactic oriented point of view in analizing human language, from empirical data to theoretical perspective in order to describe language variations within a parametrical possibility of displacement and ordering of syntactic structures.

Aim of this paper is to consider grammatical case assignment and alternation in Finnish paradigm, showing up how Functional categories inside and outside DP-shells enter into derivation and how they check Case on NPs.
