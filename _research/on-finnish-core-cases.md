Analysis of case marking phenomenon is one of the major ﬁeld raised up in thelast decades of linguistics studies. It is ﬁrstly due to the growing of syntacticoriented point of view in analizing human language, from empyrical datainto theoretical perspective in order to describe language variations within a parametrical possibility of displacement and ordering of syntactic structures.

Aim of this paper is to consider grammatical case assignment and alternation in Finnish paradigm, showing up how Functional categories insideand outside DP-shells enter into derivation and how they check Case on NPs.
